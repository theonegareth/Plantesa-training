# Water Tank Training

This project is dedicated to developing a machine learning model for predicting and analyzing water tank-related data. The workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, is detailed in the `water_tank_training.ipynb` notebook.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To create a robust model for water tank data analysis.
- **Key Features**: Data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

## Project Structure

- **`water_tank_training.ipynb`**: The primary notebook containing the complete workflow.
- **`data/`**: Directory for storing input datasets. Ensure the required data is placed here before running the notebook.
- **`results/`**: Folder for saving outputs, including trained models and evaluation metrics.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `water_tank_training` directory.
2. Place the necessary datasets in the `data/` folder.
3. Open and execute the `water_tank_training.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in the notebook)
