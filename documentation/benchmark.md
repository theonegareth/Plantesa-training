# Model Benchmarking: Leaf Disease Detection

This document summarizes the benchmarking process for the leaf disease detection model.

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and results for evaluating the performance of the trained model on various datasets.

## Benchmarking Steps

1. **Prepare Test Data**  
    Ensure the test dataset is organized and preprocessed as required by the model.

2. **Run Inference**  
    Use the provided scripts to generate predictions on the test set.

3. **Evaluate Metrics**  
    Calculate key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Compare Results**  
    Benchmark the model against baseline or previous versions.

## Usage

This notebook verifies the accuracy of the model that has been trained. 

## Results

| Metric    | Value   |
|-----------|---------|
| Accuracy  | 0.95    |
| Precision | 0.93    |
| Recall    | 0.92    |
| F1-score  | 0.925   |

## Notes

- Update the metrics table after each benchmark run.
- For reproducibility, document the environment and dependencies.
