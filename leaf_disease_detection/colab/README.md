# Leaf Disease Detection using Google Colab

This project focuses on detecting leaf diseases using machine learning models. The implementation is designed to run on Google Colab, leveraging its computational resources for training and inference.

## Features
- Preprocessing of leaf images.
- Training a machine learning model for disease classification.
- Evaluation of model performance.
- Easy-to-use Google Colab notebook.

## Requirements
To use this project, ensure you have:
- A Google account to access Google Colab.
- A dataset of leaf images with labeled diseases.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/theonegareth/Plantesa-training.git
    cd Plantesa-training/leaf_disease_detection/colab
    ```
2. Open the Colab notebook:
    - Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    - Upload the notebook file from this directory.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
    - Upload your dataset.
    - Preprocess the images.
    - Train the model.
    - Evaluate the results.

## Dataset
Ensure your dataset is organized as follows:
```
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── class_1/
│   ├── class_2/
│   └── ...
├── val/
│   ├── class_1/
│   ├── class_2/
│   └── ...
```
