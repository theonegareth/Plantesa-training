# Leaf Disease Detection Training (Visual Studio Code)

This repository contains a project for training a model to detect leaf diseases using machine learning and computer vision. The training process is conducted using Visual Studio Code.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation.
- Model training for disease classification.
- Visual Studio Code-based workflow for flexibility and efficiency.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Visual Studio Code
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/theonegareth/Plantesa-training.git
    cd Plantesa-training/leaf_disease_detection
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code:
    ```bash
    code .
    ```

4. Configure the Python environment:
    - Ensure the Python extension is installed in Visual Studio Code.
    - Select the appropriate Python interpreter for the project.

5. Run the training script:
    - Navigate to the `src/` directory and execute the training script using the integrated terminal.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains datasets for training and testing.
- `models/`: Pre-trained and custom models for disease detection.
- `src/`: Source code for preprocessing and training.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage
1. Place leaf images in the `data/input` directory.
2. Open the training script in Visual Studio Code and follow the steps to train the model.
3. Save the trained model for future use.
